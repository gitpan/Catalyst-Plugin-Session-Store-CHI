NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::CHI - Use CHI module to handle storage
    backend for session data.

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst qw/Session Session::Store::CHI::File Session::State::Foo/;

        MyApp->config->{'Plugin::Session'} = {
            storage => '/tmp/session'
        };

        # ... in an action:
        $c->session->{foo} = 'bar'; # will be saved

DESCRIPTION
    `Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::CHI' is an easy to use storage plugin
    for Catalyst that uses a file or mmap'ed file to act as a shared memory
    interprocess cache. It is based on `CHI'. At this point only file
    functionality is available via
    `Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::CHI::File'. This module is
    expiremental.

  METHODS
    get_session_data
    store_session_data
    delete_session_data
    delete_expired_sessions
        These are implementations of the required methods for a store. See
        Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store.

    setup_session
        Sets up the session cache file.

CONFIGURATION
    These parameters are placed in the hash under the `Plugin::Session' key
    in the configuration hash.

    storage
        Specifies the directory root to be used for the sharing of session
        data. The default value will use File::Spec to find the default
        tempdir, and use a file named `MyApp/session/data', where `MyApp' is
        replaced with the appname.

        Note that the file will be created with mode 0640, which means that
        it will only be writeable by processes running with the same uid as
        the process that creates the file. If this may be a problem, for
        example if you may try to debug the program as one user and run it
        as another, specify a directory like `/tmp/session-$>', which
        includes the UID of the process in the filename.

    relative
        Makes the storage path relative to *$c-*path_to>

    namespace
        The namespace associated with this cache. Defaults to an empty
        string if not explicitly set. If set, the session data will be
        stored in a directory called `MyApp/session/data/<namespace'>.

    cache_depth
        The number of subdirectories deep to session object item. This
        should be large enough that no session directory has more than a few
        hundred objects. Defaults to 3 unless explicitly set.

    directory_umask
        The directories in the session on the filesystem should be globally
        writable to allow for multiple users. While this is a potential
        security concern, the actual cache entries are written with the
        user's umask, thus reducing the risk of cache poisoning. If you
        desire it to only be user writable, set the 'directory_umask' option
        to '077' or similar. Defaults to '000' unless explicitly set.
